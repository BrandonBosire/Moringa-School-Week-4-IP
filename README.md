#  {BLUECAR OPTIMIZER}
####  {This is a python program that identifies the peak hour for picking up of a shared electric car (known as Bluecar) in the city of Paris.},{Current version date:Friday 23rd September 2021}
##  Description
{The program will be based off source data ,an excel dataset, called Autolib_dataset.The main function of the program is for searching through this specific dataset and returning peak hour for picking up a shared electric car,this has been specified to be the Blue car as there are two other vehicles Utilib and Utilib 1.4.The dataset is based on a survey done in the month of April in the  year 2018, it only included nine days of the month, starting fromthe first to the ninth.Primarily there was a need to clean the dataset in tune with the requirements therefore much of the datathat didnot help was removed(it was deemed irrelevant but only in relation to our case).It should be noted that th program only works for this specific dataset type,this means that any data that is to be processed through this program should have the same number of columns and column attributes.}
##  Installation Requirements.
*From the GitHub Apps settings page, select your notebook program.

*In the left sidebar, click Install notebook.

*Click Install next to the organization or user account containing the correct repository.

*Install the notebook on select repositories.

*Once installed, you will see configuration options for the notebook on your selected account. 

*Prerequisite is the lastest python notebook as of 23/1/2021.*

{This app is a python based app and as such the order code should be of python language.This will ensure smooth functionality and peak performance.}
##  Known Bugs
{As of the date of creation there have been no known bugs.But due to the data source that the program is based on, a strict condition for all datasets that are to be worked on by this app are that of the format.The data should of the same format and have the same attributes,it is best that the data be corrected to match the original data if the end data is to match the one seen in this repository.Another keynote is that if there are to been future bugs these will only be if there is a new version of the python program that had any used coded either updated or removed.}
##  Technologies Used
{The language used is Python language.In particular the main tool is a jupyter notebook.Special languages used are the pandas library, the numpy library , the matplotlib library and the seaborn library.}
##  Support 
{For further assistance or contribution feel free to contact this email :brandon.moreno@student.moringaschool.com. Or even better contribute to the code and after review it will added.}
